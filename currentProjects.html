              <h2>The Telecart</h2>
              <p>Imagine your local grocery store at peak hour. People running up and down isles with carts, bumping into each other. Its chaos right? Now imagine the same grocery store but now instead of a cart you had a teleporter gun that would shoot aa portal to checkout so you don't have to carry all your groceries. I took a lot of inspiration from Fallout Shelter's designing and branding within the game. The actual gun pictured is the portal gun from the game Portal.</p>

              <p>Meet Fizzy, a bright, colorful, a little chaotic, retro energy drink. This is how I envision myself as a food product! An energy drink that has many flavors and kinda reminds you of the 80s but in a modern synthwave era.</p>

              <h2>TexaCo Logo</h2>
              <p>Client asked for a neon logo that incorporates elements of both Colorado and Texas. The logo specifically had to glow in UV light once printed on shirts. So I had to dip into researching into neon fabric paints and the color that correlates on screen. </p>
