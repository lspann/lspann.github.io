    <ul>
      <li>I put in the initial files for all the pages and images. I put them in the HTML folder so it could be easy to find.</li>
      <li>I then added a new file named page5.html for the nav bar. I put all the links to the restt of the pages so they could be accessable.</li>
      <li>For page1.html I added a DOCTYPE and language tag to complete the boiler plate. I added an end paragraph tag and a italized tag.</li>
      <li>For page2.html I added a bold tag and a paragraoh tag. I also ordered the headers in the correct order, as well as deleted a end thematic break tag. Then I went back and fixed a broken link.</li>
      <li>For page3.html I added a list tag and ordered the table tags correctly. I then reordered the information in the table to be correct.</li>
      <li>For page4.html I added a DOCTYPE for the boilder plate and alt refrences for all the images.</li>
      <li>For page5.html then I finally finished up all the pages and made sure the website worked well with all the pages.</li>
    </ul>
